## Notes
- Do **not** edit files directly in `~/` â€” always edit via chezmoi (`chezmoi edit ~/.bashrc`, etc.)
- Sensitive files like `.wakatime.cfg` and `.ssh/` are ignored for security.
- Themes are synced via `~/.themes/`.

---

## Security
- No SSH keys or secret files are included in the repository.
- Always double-check what chezmoi is managing with `chezmoi status`.
